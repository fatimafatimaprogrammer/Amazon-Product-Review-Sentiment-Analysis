"I bought this after lot of deliberation and I am glad I did. I have very very dry skin so the sun cream I bought in past were sticky and would give me a feeling of sweaty, which was not a great feeling. I used this (almost finished) and I wouldn't mind a little bit of fragrance but this has none which is okay. It gives white cast after one spread and if you keep evenly spreading the cream on the face the white cast is gone (in few circular motions).  All in all I found this cream amazing.",bioderma,good,5

I have roseaca & it, for me, works with it without aggravating it - I had previously been using a cheaper face one but for some reason it suddenly started really making the roseaca burn itchy sore & uncomfortable so I found this referenced on a roseaca forum and gave it a try. The price, mainly because of the postage, did make me eeek a bit but to be fair a little goes a long way & for a work day one application + make up lasts the whole day, although I do not seek out the sun at lunchtime. It does not dry streaky and I found it moisturising enough not to need moisturiser on top. I shall certainly be ordering again.",bioderma,avg,3.5

"Bought from seller OEMGenuine. All things are fine regarding Seller and Condition. I would purchase another Laptop from OEMGenuine if I needed to.The Laptop itself is bad. Thinkpad E14 model.There is no CD/DVD Drive, you have to buy an external One if you want to do something as basic as watch DVDs on it now. I guess Computer Manufacturers have decided for Us that ""nobody wants that anymore.""There is no Number Pad. Some people don't care about Number pads, but this Laptop doesn't even give you the Option to ignore it. There just isn't One! You will have to buy an external Number Pad if you want One.There are bright white LED Indicators for Key Locks, and also for the Power Button, and they cannot be disabled. When the Laptop is in Sleep Mode it will slowly pulse its white Light and illuminate the whole Room at Night. Only the Laptop can sleep through this. The LEDs are eyesores even with normal usage. White is an inappropriate color for an LED Indicator on a Laptop.The keyboard has chiclet style Keys in an ""island style"", so they're built into a plastic Frame with individual gaps for each Key, and the Keys rise out of the Gaps. Proponents of this Keyboard Style sometimes say that it helps keep Debris from getting under the Keys. But they are wrong. Debris will get into the Keys unless you are Computing in a Sterile Laboratory, and when Debris does get under one of the Keys you can't pry the Key up to remove the Debris even a little bit, and you can't shoot compressed Air underneath the Key to dislodge it. You will just have to mash the key around and try to crunch the Debris into slightly less intrusive Grit. (Bear in mind that we suggest NOT removing the Keys manually for cleaning - Chiclet Key Retainers love to break when lifted from Above.)Very poor design Decisions made for such an expensive Laptop. It used to be that spending more Money would get you more or better Features. Now it just buys sharper Build Quality and prestigious Brand Name.",Lenovo e14,bad,3.5

"I recently migrated to Apple after many years using a wide variety of PCs running Windows or Linux. I decided to make that move after Apple's introduction of the M1 processor, which has been proven to be an excellent hardware platform. Now. of course, the M2 has been released, but, depending on your needs, the 2020 Macbook Air with the M1 will save you some money while still delivering outstanding performance and some of the most attractively and perfectly manufactured hardware. You can search the Internet for professional reviews of the Macbook Air, but I feel confident you'll find plenty to verify what I'm saying.The Retina display is beautiful. The sound system is superior to any other laptop I have owned or used. The battery holds up all day under typical use, and I can verify that the battery holds its charge well for at least a week while the notebook is powered off. The Apple OS (Monterey) is smooth and fast, and I was able to learn my way around in it quickly. When you need help, a Google search will yield tons of tips quickly, or you can avail yourself of Apple support.I will say that the Air is a little short on USB ports, lacks a built-in card slot, and, of course, is not equipped with a touchscreen. However, I have run a USB hub from one of the two Thunderbolt ports, and there seems to be enough power to support my flash drives and card readers...even a portable DVD-burner. As far as a touchscreen goes, I have that on a Dell laptop I run Linux on, but I never use it...guess I'm a mouse or touchpad guy.The aluminum housing is beautifully machined and finished, the keyboard has a very nice touch, the battery seems to charge quickly, and the Air is light at under 3 lbs.One last thing! I have been a heavy user of both Google and Microsoft services, and I have found that Apple provides ample support for integrating those services into the Mac environment. I run Google's Backup and Sync and Microsoft's OneDrive with no problems. My AVG subscription allows me to use my antivirus software on both Mac OS and Windows machines.I have no regrets for this purchase. Actually, the Air was my 3rd M1 Mac. I also have an iMac and a Mac Mini. They all work together very well!",macbook pro m1,good,5

"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!",macbook pro m1,good,4.6

"I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage).  I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly).  Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO.  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously.  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in.  Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected.  I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool.  In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is).  Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine.  I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser.  The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.The only cons I see are minor in my opinion.  Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store.  There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair.  For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity.  I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs.  To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding.  For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine ""has NO USB PORTS!!!"", which is patently false.  In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector.  What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub.  USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.All things considered, I really love this machine.  The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699.  Considering that I'll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again.",macbook pro m1,good,4.7

"Took my chance and bought one used off Amazon warehouse deals. It's brand new except the warranty has only a few months left. Can't complain at all! This computer is awesome as I upgraded from 2013 Macbook Pro Retina. It's way faster. But 8GB of ram will be slow at times, and the laptop gets hot during summer months. Also the trackpad has a tendency of dragging instead of clicking when you're clicking around really fast. Like when you're trying to get that hot concert ticket, and you click really fast on Ticketmaster, it drags the text or link instead of clicking on it like it should which causes a second of two of delay. I hope they get this fixed but it's unlikely they will ever notice this. Most people don't use trackpad to click as fast as me.",macbook pro m1,good,4.8

"I bought this for my wife as I am a PC guy and this is a first impression review.  Like all things Apple, it is nice to look at with a sleek design and the screen that is sharp and clear.  I always read the negative reviews and a lot of folks complained there were no USB ports.  This isn't entirely true, it says it comes with 2 USB C ports and it does.  A simple thumb adapter ($5) is all you need to use a regular USB device.  HOWEVER, I was expected an SD card slot that is not there.  That was disappointing but, again, an adapter can solve that.  My wife loved the fact that almost as soon as she connected to our network, it almost instantly transferred everything from her phone and 10 year old MacBook.  So far, she is pleased with this purchase.  Additional items needed:  Clear protective cover and screen protector $16, adapters $10, MS Office Home for Mac, $149.",macbook pro m1,avg,3.7

"I decided to take a chance with MacOS and the at the time of purchase discounted Macbook Air. At first, I liked it a lot and was very impressed. However, over time, I quickly grew to dislike how strict MacOS is with installing things like an overbearing parent. While I personally didn't find this to be the laptop of choice, I cannot deny the excellent screen, insane battery life and great keyboard. The usage of the Macbook Air is too limited for what I use computers for, but for people with more basic needs or that use productivity apps constantly, it's an excellent selection. It just wasn't the all-rounded I had hoped it would be.",macbook pro m1,good,4.7
"I'm a software developer and I've only used PC for my entire career. I've been using the windows subsystem for Linux and other Unix based shells for work for a long time and I've always had the desire to try development on a Mac.I assumed that it would be like any other Windows machine that's had the OS replaced with Linux, one of my favorite computers was a Lenovo with Ubuntu on it so that's what I expected.I bought a Surface Pro X which has an ARM based processor (ms sq1 chip) so I thought that I knew what to expect, I assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software I used probably wouldn't work correctly but I have to say that Apple did so much better than Microsoft on this one. The M1 chip makes this $1,000 laptop feel like a $2500 laptop. I've only run into one application that couldn't run and the general online community recommended an alternative for me.the most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once I did, this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my Surface laptop 3 as my daily driver and primary software development machine.I might revert to my Surface laptop three if I go back to .NET development in the future but for the general web stuff I typically do, I couldn't ask for a better machine.The battery life is excellent, this laptop feels premium, I have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about Apple.The biggest downside in my opinion is that I spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because Apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustrating.One thing that everyone should be aware of is that you can't connect this laptop to two separate external displays. I had to get used to One external display and then using a virtual desktop. That is unfortunate because I really liked having three monitors at all times but I haven't found a way to make it work with this machine.Generally speaking, I would recommend this to anybody who's considering it. Unless you are a PC gamer, there's very little that this computer won't excel at. I'd argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two, and I have historically been very critical of Apple.",macbook pro m1,good,4.5
"I have had the M1 MacBook Air 13-inch now since December 2020. It has served me so well and has been one of the most reliable laptops I've ever owned. I am originally a PC guy and now work back and forth between Windows OS and Mac OS.When it comes to rendering videos and clips, this does a way better job at 4K resolution compared to my former Alienware 17 inch laptop AND my workplace's gaming desktop!I am pretty happy with the battery life so far. I have been getting 10+ hours of hard real-world usage. I bring a nice USB-C portable battery with me to charge it when I am doing work on the weekends out of town or while on the plane. This thing has not failed me once.8GB of RAM is more than enough for the majority of consumers and is enough for me even though I edit photos and videos all the time. I have not seen any ""throttling"" from the M1 MacBook Air since ownership. I can even open up 30+ tabs on Chrome without issue.256GB storage is enough as long as you have an external storage. I highly recommend investing in getting an SSD or NVMe external storage so transfer speeds are optimal. Otherwise, as long as you are keeping the core hard drive tidy, you won't run into any storage issues.Virtual classes are nice. The webcam quality is crystal clear, and it is noticeably better than most of my peers.My only complaint is that the design is a bit ""outdated"" despite how premium and beautiful it is.Just FYI. I just bought two of these; one for myself and one for my friend who just had a massive upgrade from her ""prehistoric"" 2010 iMac. She was absolutely mindblown by how much faster and better it is compared to the older iMac.Overall, this is a very nice all-around computer laptop for ANY student from K all the way up to the graduate level.

"What I love about this sunscreen is that:- Unlike many other products that claim to control oil, this actually makes me less oily and stays matte for a long time- Goes well under a little makeupWhat I hate:- Burns around the eyes, especially when I wash it off- It's very hard to spread and you need time to work it on- sometimes it pills and sticks to baby hairs- Leaves a bit of a white cast. It's not too obvious on my ""light medium"" skin tone but I wouldn't recommend this for tan or deep skin tones",neutrogena,good,4.7
"It works well and doesn't feel greasy or look shiny.  BUT I would not advise using it on your forehead if you'll be sweating (I don't know about swimming) because it WILL run and get in your eyes and it WILL NOT feel good.

"Out of the box the X1 Carbon is an impressive machine.  Very light weight and aesthetically pleasing.  The keyboard is a pleasure to use and the touchpad is much better than other PCs I've recently used.  The model I have has the standard 1920 x 1080 display which is fine for an ultraportable.  Should you desire something comparable to a Mac Retina display, I recommend upgrading to the Lenovo hi-res HDR display.  For typical business use - email, MS Office, web browsing, video conferencing, etc., the Intel 8th Gen i5 processor, 256GB SSD and 8GB RAM configuration is fine.  The X1 also has a good array of ports including USB A-type, USB-C/Thunderbolt, and HDMI.  After a few days of use, battery life is impressive -- probably 10 hours with web browsing, Office, and email usage.  The only knock I'd give it in terms of hardware is the lid has a lot of flex to it, but I suppose this is to be expected since it's not aluminum.  The other negative is not the fault of the hardware, but rather Windows 10.  Setup was tedious.  After going through multiple rounds of updates taking a couple of hours, I had to do a full reset and start over because the Start Menu would not save any changes.  I would delete the Windows Games and other bloatware I don't need only to have it reappear.  I am not set up on a domain where a Group Policy is doing this, so I decided to reset and that solved the problem.  I also had to do a BIOS update and some Lenovo-dictated driver updates.  After three days of use, all has been good.

"I purchased a Lenovo X1 Carbon (i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD HD) after having some hardware issues with other work laptops. I needed a high end, limited frills, portable laptop to do heavy duty business work on. And not much else. I don't play games or watch movies on this, I don't do graphics or rendering work. I don't code. Other than work (heavy duty office-suite use, software used through browsers, etc.) all I need this computer for is an occasional youtube video.What I've dealt with since receiving this machine has turned me off from Lenovo forever. The computer itself is as advertisedÖlight, powerful, simple. No touch screen, the keyboard is decent, everything else is great. So far I'd give it a B+.EXCEPT yesterday it started having charging issues after 15 days of use. The computer isn't charging correctly, it's indicating it's connected when it's not, and it's telling me that the power cord I have is the wrong wattage for this computer. Even though it's a) not, and b) been working fine since I got it. And my external monitor flashes on and off. According to the Lenovo client, all of my stuff is up-to-date and working correctly.Enter Lenovo's superior customer support team to fix my issues right away.JUST KIDDING.Enter Lenovo's frustrating but navigate-able menu and (wait for it)Ö.A SALES AND SUPPORT TEAM THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM 9PM EST ON FRIDAY UNTIL 9AM EST ON MONDAY.Can you imagine? A company with an enterprise value north of $13BN, and they won't pay for support on the weekends. Un-freaking-believable.Furthermore, the support staff I talked to (before they locked up the office for the weekend) said that the turn-around time to repair my computer would be 7 business days. Like, no big deal, right? I'll just use pen and paper for a week and a half while my two-week-old computer maybe gets fixed.Or I could talk to sales about getting a new one sent to me, so I can spend a few hours getting my new computer set up and the old one wiped then sent back to you. Oh, but they don't work on the weekends either. (You CAN, however, order a new product by talking to someone through chat on the weekends, but no sales support or technical support.)OR I could take my computer to a certified Lenovo repair site. I live in the SF Bay AreaÖhardly the middle of nowhere.There is one location within an hour of me.And it's closed on the weekends.There's one more right at an hour from me. I'm not sure if it's open on the weekends. They didn't answer their phone and their website hasn't been updated since 2009.So here I am, wasting my Saturday and NOT spending time with my family because I'm trying to resolve computer issues on a brand new computer with a giant corporation that has 0 resources available to support me on the weekends, as I prepare to get on the road for work tomorrow for a week. Fortunately, I'll be backÖ.late Friday.JUST IN TIME FOR THEM TO CLOSE UP SHOP FOR THE WEEKEND AGAIN.ThinkPad products might be great. I'm not sure. I've heard decent things. But if you end up with a lemon, better start blocking off big chunks of time on your calendar to fix it yourself, because you're going to be left high and dry by Lenovo. Because who really cares about the little guy, right? It's just some shmuck who bought a $2500 laptop computer from an IBM owned company.",lenovo x1 carbon,avg,4.2
"After going through several xps 13 and x1 carbons (I sell electronics) I replaced my XPS13 9370 8250u laptop with this X1 carbon ultrabook and overall i like this one better.  The xps had brighter screen and better color reproduction, much nicer design, better battery.The x1 carbon has the same weight as xps 13 which was a decisive point for me,  and as a bonus a bigger and more usable 14"" screen. While the trackpad on xps 13 is slightly better (both are great) the keyboard on the x1 is absolutely amazing in comparison to xps 13 which is also good but nowhere near as great.The X1 carbon has a worse thermal solution than the xps 13 and as a result is obnoxiously louder and runs hotter. I solved this issue by repasting the heatsink with noctua nt-h1 paste (i recommend this one, it's easy to spread compared to other paste) After repasting the XPS13 i couldn't hear the fans anymore, but on the X1 carbon they where still on more often than i like.There is a software called ThrottleStop that helped me lower the temperatures down , improve the battery life and make fans silent.  It can be configured to run minimized automatically on windows startup (task scheduler)Before temps where at ~38c Min - 65C maximum. Now they are at 27c Min, 44C max.For reading PDFs and using Office Word on this laptop i turned off turbo boost and undervolted a few option settings. The cpu now consumes as low as 0.1w power and 3.75w max.I wouldn't recommend any ultrabook that has a 4k display or i7 CPU. (i previously had both on xps 13 and carbon x1)While the 4k is very nice to look at, it makes the ultrabook run a lot hotter.  The same goes for the CPU which is also a waste of money in comparison to an i5. If performance is important you shouldn't buy an ultrabook at all.",lenovo x1 carbon,avg,4.4

I read the reviews here and saw that some said this left a cast and some said that it cleared after the product was absorbed.  I thought to myself even if it did leave a slight cast, it would be okay as I am really fair skinned (actually I am pretty pale).  Just as some background, I wear very little makeup, usually just a CC Cream for ""foundation"".This product works in providing great sun protection that does not irritate my sensitive skin and does not clog my pores.  However, the cast does NOT go away for me once it is absorbed, so I can only imagine how it is for those with darker skin than mine.  I tried using my normal CC cream over it and that just made it an even weirder cast.  I am going to try the tinted one but until it arrives, I will resemble Casper.",cerave,bad,3.1

From there the white cast is not a problem. It looks natural in photos and under makeup. The most important thing to me is protection to prevent hyperpigmentation and I've been using about 3 wks.

"I was tired of spending $40 on other facial sunscreens, so decided to give this a try. Yes, it does the job and provides solid protection from the sun. BUT, and this is a deal-breaker for me, it takes forever to absorb into your face. I like to put sunscreen on under my foundation every day (I live in Phoenix and being in the sun is often unavoidable), and even a ""normal"" dose of this makes your face completely white and ghost-like for hours. So I won't be purchasing again. I think this product is better served for people hanging out by the pool. I wouldn't call this a daily sunscreen.",cerave,bad,3.1
"It honestly not that good for cerave products, one it stinks like chemicals but it smells a lot like thread locker to me, the sunscreen is thicccccc and hard to blend out but other then that itís good lol",cerave,avg,3.7
"This is a good product for it for my husband and dad, they ended up not using them because the crËme used sooo visible and does not absorb.",cerave,bad,3.4
When using it it is very flakey and difficult to rub into the skin. I always look super pale and  it isn't just me not rubbing it in well. Idk why it has that weird consistency but it does and it sucks,cerave,bad,3.1
"First of all it's really hard to produce an spf50 sunscreen that does not leave any white cast...I would not recommend this sunscreen for darker shades unless you want to look like Mark Zuckerberg surfing in Hawaii... Even applying a pea sized amount of sunscreen will leave a very noticeable white cast. The CeraVe spf 30 is much better for darker skin tones if you really work it in. However, if you have pale skin like me, their spf 50 really isn't too bad. Taking this into account I want to point out the positives of this sunscreen.1. It does not have that think sunscreen smell. It doesn't have any smell, which is nice. I wear sunscreen everyday of the year and it is nice to have one that does not have me smelling like a pool.2. It blends in fairly nicely when your face is moisturized. When I first started putting on this sunscreen, I was disappointed because I have very pale skin with rosacea on my cheeks. Even with my pale skin, the white cast was noticeable for the rest of the day. However, I noticed that if my face is moisturized or even a little greasy before application. It will not leave a horrible white cast.3. It soothed my rosacea. My face is pretty much red all the time and looks irritated after a workout. However, after a few weeks of using this sunscreen, I noticed that my rosacea is pretty calm at the end of the day. This only happens when I wear this sunscreen. I am not sure if it is because of the niacinamide in this sunscreen, but that was a nice surprise.",cerave,avg,3.6
A little of product goes a long way because it leaves a white cast on skin that is hard to spread out. Its thick when applying but it doesnít feel like it on the face. Theres no sunscreen smell to it!,cerave,bad,3.4

"I have been using this product for my face for several years. This is the one that has worked best for me, giving me protection when no other product has.I see reviews that say it gives a white cast and is hard to spread.I use a tiny bit of moisturizer first, and before it dries I apply the Cerave.That helps it to spread easily and absorb completely-no white cast for me.If you have dark skin you may wish to avoid products with zinc oxide.",cerave,good,4.9
This product works really well and spreads super easily. I like the feeling of it on and it doesn't have any oily after residue. My only complaint is that the white tint is pretty bad on this one. It takes a while to get it in your skin enough to even leave the house.,cerave,good,4.8
"CeraVe is a great brand, contains good ingredients but leaves a white cast on your skin.",cerave,avg,3.7
The perfect protection and the moisturizer,cerave,good,5
Putting sunscreen on was never a normal part of my skincare routine until recently. I tried a few primers with sunscreen and they would give little to no protection and wore off quickly. I absolutely love this product. I havenít had a sunburn on my face all summer.,cerave,good,5
Love it,cerave,good,5
I like it  I'm  using every  also my skin look  flawless..,cerave,good,5
Works nice and removed my acne scars. Has white residue after applying.,cerave,good,5
"Unfortunately leaves a white cast on my face, I'll probably only use it for beach.It doesn't leave any white cast on neck and other areas.",cerave,avg,3.6
All the chemical sunscreens seem to irritate my eyes.  The zinc ones don't.  This product is not that thick but it doesn't fully disappear no matter how much you work it in.  There is a white sheen to my face.  I also feel it doesn't really dry with a dewy feel to the skin instead of dry.  I'll continue to use this until I find something better.,cerave,bad,3.5
Goes on easily for great coverage.,cerave,good,5
"I have a very sensitive skin and surfing in the Californian sun is pretty brutal.Despite spreading the sunscreen a lot and regularly, I got sunburnt.Would not recommend for water and extreme conditions.However the screen did not create any dermatological issues.",cerave,bad,3.1
"I'm sure it provides good protection, but it was impossible to spread it nicely on my face... I always just ended up looking like I had a thick layer of white stuff on my face. I guess that's fine for going to the beach but not really acceptable for life in the city. I much prefer CeraveAM because it can be rubbed in reasonably-well and I don't end up looking like a ghost (though I guess it's not quite as protective as this product).",cerave,bad,3.1
This was great except left my olive skin white. Had to send back.,cerave,bad,3.2
For women of color.. youíll appear ashy,cerave,bad,3.3
"Works GREAT for sun protection and if you have semi-sensitive skin it didnít ever break me out or irritate my skin. Kinda hard to rub in/spread, and DEFINITELY leaves a white cast no matter how much you rub it in.",cerave,avg,3.6
"I have used other products from this brand before and have liked them a lot, however this was not great. This stuff is so thick that I have to thin it out with moisturizer, and even then it just sits on top of my skin making me look Gastly pale IF I managed to get all the lines out. In the future I would probably only wear this if I was going to then put makeup on top",cerave,avg,3.8
"Good sunscreen, however, it's not the easiest to spread and leaves white undertone.",cerave,avg,3.9
"This protected me from the sun, but I had to rub the sunscreen in for like 7 minutes because it left such a white cast on my face, I felt like I put on foundation for clown makeup",cerave,bad,3.2
I got this because I wanted a sunblock to apply under my makeup. This was not it. Not only does it leave really bad white cast but itís hard to spread and doesnít sit well under foundation.,cerave,bad,3.1
"I had very high hopes for this as I love & use many CeraVe products. While this did a great job of protecting my face from the sun, it was extremely hard to spread & left a white film over my face. No matter how much I tried to rub it in, it still remained white & thick feeling.",cerave,bad,3.1
"I am naturally pale as a ghost, so this may be playing a part in it but I did have some white cast immediately after putting it on, but working it in and letting it set did the trick. My skin feels smooth and hydrated, not sticky at all and I love that there is no added scent.",cerave,good,5
There is no problem with this product.,cerave,good,5
"Since this is a mineral sunscreen it does leave a white chalky effect on the face. The sunscreen does need to be applied or blended throughly, which takes a lot of time. But it does give a good protection.",cerave,avg,3.7
"I love Cerave products. And I was excited to buy this 50 spf sunblock for the face.  When I finally used it, I found that it was difficult to blend onto skin and it leaves an obvious white cast! It also clumps up on pores and black heads that is clearly visible to the naked eye. I don't think I'll purchase this again unfortunately.",cerave,bad,3.1
I have been a big fan of CeraVe for a long time. I use their face wash daily and day creams for under eyes and face. I am not in the Sun much ~ but occasionally do go outside. This is wonderful as I do not sweat it off!,cerave,good,5
Not at all easy to spread or be absorbed.  Very white.,cerave,bad,3.2
Does not blend in. Leaves skin tacky and glowing. Very disappointed.,cerave,bad,3.3
"This feels great on the skin and good for sun protection, but does not blend into the skin.  Leaves a heavy white cast which wouldnít look pretty going out into public.  Not an everyday SPF to wear under makeup.",cerave,bad,3.2
"CeraVe is a great Zinc based sunscreen when you have to be outdoors a long time, otherwise it is too thick, too white and pore clogging.  I only use it if I'm going to be outside for long periods of time, it always clogs my pores where other sunscreens don't.",cerave,avg,3.9
Works great protecting my skin from sun.  Just wont use on my face.  Looks like you dipped your face in flour when dry.,cerave,bad,3.1
Moisturizing but leaves too much of a white cast on your face.,cerave,bad,3.4
Even as a pasty ginger the white paint-like consistency was a difficult to manage. It doesn't spread well and hardly rubs in. Definitely not for days you want to look cute. But it works well.,cerave,avg,3.8
This product is to heavy in the face,cerave,bad,3.2
"Perfect for my night skin and will last me forever! You only need at most a pea sized amount, I use about half of that.",cerave,good,4.7
"I use this brands products for my face wash and face lotion, love CeraVe! This is my first time using the sunscreen and never again! It leaves the dreaded white cast that those with dark skin like to avoid. Itís also very drying so was hard to spread it out to try and reduce the cast. I have dry skin so because itís no hydrating itís made me feel itchy. If you have oily skin youíll be fine though, makes you very matte!",cerave,avg,3.7
Itís fine to use on your face if you donít mind having to wear foundation directly on top of it to offset the intense white cast.,cerave,good,4.5
Great balm.  I think affordable.  A bit better quality and density over the Cetaphil balm.,cerave,good,4.6
I love CeraVeís facial 30 spf because it doesnít leave my skin with a white residue. In fact I love Most of their moisturizers. I wanted to give this product a try because I needed more coverage. It is very effective but it did leave a very white residue on my face and wouldnít blend well with my makeup.,cerave,bad,3.5
I love most of their products but the sunscreen doesnít rub all the way in to my face which is such a bummer. It definitely leaves a white cast on my face.,cerave,avg,3.5

"This is from a favorite company for facial moisturizers. I wanted a non chemical facial SPF to use daily without needing to put regular products on first and was hoping for an economical alternative to my favorite El** MD, but this is not sheer for the face. Oh well. Iíll use it on the back of my neck and arms!",cerave,avg,3.8
"I can't believe I paid $16 to look like a kabuki reject. Goes on difficult, leaves you looking like a corpse, hard to remove, and gave me a headache almost immediately. At least it doesn't smell. I'll try it again next time I work outside. Definitely for when you don't care what you look like but don't want skin cancer. Can't imagine wearing it with makeup. Might work under it but they insist you put it on last. Hilarious. I don't think it'll hold up under sweat. Maybe try a sweat band around the hairline.",cerave,bad,3.1
